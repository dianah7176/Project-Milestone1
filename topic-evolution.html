      <h1>The Evolution of HTTP</h1>
      <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has evolved through multiple versions since 1991. Each version introduced features that improved web speed, reliability, and scalability.</p>

      <!-- Section for HTTP/0.9 -->
      <section>
        <h2>HTTP/0.9 — The Beginning</h2>
        <p>HTTP/0.9 appeared in 1991 and supported only the GET method. It returned raw HTML with no headers. This version focused on simplicity but lacked flexibility for multimedia or metadata.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section for HTTP/1.0 -->
      <section>
        <h2>HTTP/1.0 — Expanding the Protocol</h2>
        <p>Released in 1996, HTTP/1.0 introduced request and response headers, content types, and status codes. This upgrade allowed browsers and servers to exchange richer information and support multiple file types.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section for HTTP/1.1 -->
      <section>
        <h2>HTTP/1.1 — Improving Performance</h2>
        <p>HTTP/1.1 became the most widely adopted version for two decades. It added persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and better caching mechanisms to reduce latency and improve user experience.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section for HTTP/2 -->
      <section>
        <h2>HTTP/2 — Modern Optimization</h2>
        <p>Published in 2015, HTTP/2 replaced the text-based format with a binary framing layer. It introduced multiplexing and header compression, allowing multiple requests to share one connection and reduce overhead.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section for HTTP/3 -->
      <section>
        <h2>HTTP/3 — Built on QUIC</h2>
        <p>HTTP/3, finalized in 2022, runs over QUIC instead of TCP. QUIC uses UDP to reduce latency, integrate TLS 1.3 by default, and remove head-of-line blocking. HTTP/3 now supports major platforms like Google and Facebook.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Explain how HTTP works in practice -->
      <section>
        <h2>How HTTP Works</h2>
        <p>HTTP follows a client–server communication model. A web browser acts as the client and sends a request to a server. The server processes the request and returns a response.</p>
        <p>Each HTTP request includes a method such as GET or POST, a target URL, headers, and sometimes a message body. The server responds with a status code, headers, and the requested content.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Explain the stateless nature of HTTP -->
      <section>
        <h2>Stateless Communication</h2>
        <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol. Each request runs independently and does not rely on previous interactions.</p>
        <p>Websites use cookies and authentication tokens to create login sessions, shopping carts, and personalized user experiences.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Summary list of improvements -->
      <section>
        <h2>Key Improvements Across HTTP Versions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HTTP/1.1:</strong> Added persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and better caching.</li>
          <li><strong>HTTP/2:</strong> Introduced binary framing, multiplexing, and header compression.</li>
          <li><strong>HTTP/3:</strong> Uses the QUIC protocol over UDP to reduce latency and eliminate head-of-line blocking.</li>
        </ul>
