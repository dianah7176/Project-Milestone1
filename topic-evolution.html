      <h1>Evolution of HTTP</h1>
      <p>From the minimalist HTTP/0.9 through HTTP/1.1 and the performance-focused HTTP/2/3, the protocol evolved to meet the web’s growing needs for speed, security, and scale.</p>
      <h2>Milestones</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>HTTP/0.9</strong> (1991): GET only; raw HTML; connection closed after response.</li>
        <li><strong>HTTP/1.0</strong> (1996): Headers, status codes, and multiple media types.</li>
        <li><strong>HTTP/1.1</strong> (1997): Persistent connections, chunked transfer, better caching.</li>
        <li><strong>HTTP/2</strong> (2015): Binary framing, multiplexing, and header compression to reduce latency.</li>
        <li><strong>HTTP/3</strong> (2022): QUIC over UDP, integrated TLS 1.3, and elimination of head-of-line blocking.</li>
      </ol>
      <div id="highlight">Over time, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has evolved to make the web faster, safer, and more reliable. Each new version improved how browsers and servers communicate.

Major changes:

HTTP/0.9 and 1.0 (Early Web):

Supported only basic text transfers.

Closed the connection after every request, making it slow.

No encryption — data was sent in plain text.

HTTP/1.1 (1997):

Introduced persistent connections, allowing multiple requests on one connection.

Added caching and chunked data transfer for better performance.

Became the foundation of most early web applications.

HTTP/2 (2015):

Added multiplexing (sending many files at once) to reduce load times.

Used binary framing and header compression for efficiency.

Greatly improved speed and bandwidth use.

HTTP/3 (2022):

Built on QUIC, a new transport protocol using UDP instead of TCP.

Integrates TLS 1.3 for automatic encryption.

Eliminates “head-of-line blocking,” making pages load faster even on unstable or mobile networks.

Why these changes matter:

More secure: Every modern version now encrypts traffic by default, keeping users safer online.

Faster performance: Multiplexing and QUIC reduce waiting times and improve page loading.

Better for mobile: QUIC keeps connections stable even when switching between Wi-Fi and data.

More reliable: Built for today’s global internet, HTTP/3 handles weak connections more efficiently.</div>
