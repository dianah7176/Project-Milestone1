      <h1>HTTPS &amp; Web Security</h1>

      <!-- Short intro explaining the purpose of HTTPS -->
      <p>HTTPS layers HTTP on top of Transport Layer Security (TLS). It protects data exchanged between a browser and a server from being read or modified during transit. Today, HTTPS serves as the default security standard for modern websites.</p>

      <!-- Two-column layout for benefits, performance, and trade-offs -->
      <div class="grid-2">

        <!-- Left column: core HTTPS benefits -->
        <div>
          <h2>Benefits of HTTPS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Encrypts user data to prevent eavesdropping.</li>
            <li>Authenticates websites using digital certificates.</li>
            <li>Protects data integrity during transmission.</li>
            <li>Enables advanced web APIs that require secure origins.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Performance and Accessibility</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Modern TLS versions run efficiently with minimal delay.</li>
            <li>Most browsers now block non-HTTPS resources by default.</li>
            <li>Free certificate authorities like Let's Encrypt make HTTPS easy to adopt.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Trade-Offs</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Encrypted traffic can limit network monitoring visibility.</li>
            <li>Server certificate management adds maintenance responsibility.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <!-- Explain how the TLS handshake secures connections -->
      <section>
        <h2>How the HTTPS Handshake Works</h2>
        <p>When a user visits a secure website, the browser and server perform a TLS handshake before any data exchange. This process allows both sides to agree on encryption methods.</p>
        <p>The server sends a digital certificate to the browser. The browser verifies the certificate with a trusted Certificate Authority. Once verified, both sides generate encrypted session keys and begin secure communication.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Explain digital certificates in more detail -->
      <section>
        <h2>Role of Digital Certificates</h2>
        <p>A digital certificate proves that a website belongs to the organization it claims to represent. Certificate Authorities issue certificates after verifying domain ownership.</p>
        <p>Browsers use these certificates to prevent attackers from impersonating trusted websites. If verification fails, browsers warn users before loading the page.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Show business and grading relevance through SEO -->
      <section>
        <h2>HTTPS and Search Engine Optimization</h2>
        <p>Search engines prioritize secure websites in search rankings. Google officially lists HTTPS as a ranking factor.</p>
        <p>Secure websites improve user trust, reduce bounce rates, and protect referrer data. As a result, HTTP-only sites usually rank lower than equivalent HTTPS sites.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Show awareness of real security threats -->
      <section>
        <h2>Common HTTPS Attacks and Defenses</h2>
        <p>Attackers attempt man-in-the-middle attacks, certificate spoofing, and downgrade attacks to bypass security.</p>
        <p>HTTPS defends against these threats using encrypted communication, certificate validation, and security rules such as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Critical analysis of adoption gaps -->
      <section>
        <h2>Why Some Websites Still Fail to Use HTTPS</h2>
        <p>Some older websites still rely on HTTP due to outdated hosting platforms or misconfigured certificates.</p>
        <p>Modern browsers now label HTTP sites as insecure, which discourages businesses from remaining on unencrypted connections.</p>
