## Requirements covered
- 6+ pages with consistent layout and a shared main menu
- Proper HTML semantics with headings, lists, **image**, and **table**
- One shared `styles.css` with:
  - multiple selector types (type/class/id/attribute, plus pseudo-classes),
  - a layout using **CSS Grid** (see `.grid-2`),
  - hover effects, paddings, margins, borders, colors, and fonts
- Footer note linking to the class website

- Ready for GitHub Pages deployment

## How to deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a **public** repo named something like `it3203-milestone1-site`.
2. Upload all files at the repository root (keep the same structure).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (root)
4. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/it3203-milestone1-site/`

## Validation
- Use the W3C HTML Validator (https://validator.w3.org/) on each page URL after GitHub Pages is live.
- Fix any warnings/errors for best score.
